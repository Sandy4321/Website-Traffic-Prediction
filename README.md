# Predicting-Web-Traffic-with-FB-Prophet
Forecasting website traffic using facebook's Prophet Library

In this project I use Prophet, a library developed by Facebook to predict website traffic for orthobullets.com, the largest elearning website for orthopaedic physicians. Prophet supports some interesting features, such as "Holidays" which allow you to take into account the effects of promotions or sales when predicting future traffic.

The forecasting is done in python, a flexible and powerful language for data analysis. To start forecasting your own website traffic using Prophet, all you'll need is an account with google analytics. You can download your daily visitors into an excel spreadsheet easily and follow the steps from there.
